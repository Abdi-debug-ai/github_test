  <h3>The Wisdom of Surah Al-Kahf</h3>
       
        <p>And when setting, it passed by its left. They did not get much of its heat or of its sunbeams, neither at the beginning of the day nor at its end. As a result, their color did not change and their clothe did not wear out.

Because their eyes were wide open, if one were to look at them, one would think them awake. In reality, they were heavy with sleep. Their eyes were left open, because it was better for their eyes to be exposed to the air so that they would not get impaired with lengthy closure.

It was also narrated that an honorable angel was in charge of turning them around. They were turned on their left and right sides twice a year, so their bodies would not decay. If one was to look at them, one would be frightened by them and run away. People could not see them and could not approach them.

After three hundred nine years of sleep, Allâh woke them up. They could not stand the hunger they had. They asked one another about the length of the stay. One of them said, “We stayed one day or less than a day.” 

Another one said, “We went to sleep this morning and now the sun is getting ready to set.” The fourth one said, “Let us stop wondering. Allâh knows best how long we stayed. Anyhow, let us send one of us with some money to bring us some food. That person must be alert and smart. No one should recognize him, or else he would be followed. Then King Duqyânus and his followers would be told. They would know of our place and would inflict various types of torture on us until they deviate us from our Religion.”

After the hundreds of years that had passed King Duqyânus passed away. A pious Muslim king replaced him. The people of the city at that time were in disagreement regarding the gathering and resurrection of the bodies. Some people had doubts about it, and thought that it was very unlikely. They said that only souls would be gathered. However, the bodies will be decayed in the soil. Some of them said, “But body and soul will be equally resurrected.”

The king became distressed and a quarrel was about to happen. So he made a supplication to ask Allāh to make showing the proof of the truth easy.

At the time, Amlîkhâ, one of the men in the cave who was sent in search of food,

Reached the city of “Afsus”. He was fearful and watchful. The changes in the landmarks and the structure of the buildings surprised him. That area used to be an open land for the sheep to graze; now there were high castles. Other castles had collapsed. There were scenes he was not familiar with and faces he did not recognize.

His eyes glance became unstable; he looked confused and hesitant. Nervousness and agitation appeared in his glances and footsteps. Someone turned around and asked him, “Are you a stranger to this city, and what are you looking for?”

He said, “I am not a stranger and I am looking for food to buy. I did not find the place where I used to buy food.”

The man held his hand and took him to the owner of the restaurant. Amlîkhâ took his money out and gave it to the seller. The seller wondered, because the money had the picture of King Duqyânus on it. That king died three hundred or more years before. He thought Amlîkhâ discovered a treasure and that he had a wealth of money in his possession. People gather around Amlîkhâ sand took him to the righteous king.

The news of Amlîkhâ reached the king before his own arrival. The king was in fact waiting for him eagerly, because he had heard the story of the youngsters from his grandfather. When Amlikhâ came, the king asked him about his story. So Amlîkhâ told him what happened to him and his friends.

The king was pleased with that and said to his people, “Certainly, Allâh sent you a sign to show the truth about what you differ.”

The king, along with the people of the city walked with Amlîkhâ. When they approached the cave, Amlîkhâ said, “I will go inside first so that my friends do not get scared.” He went inside and informed his friends of what happened. He told them that King Duqyânus passed away and that the present king was a pious Muslim. They were happy with the new.

And went outside, greeted the king, then they back into their cave. When the people who doubted resurrection saw them, they gave up their incorrect belief and believed that the correct conviction is that the gathering of people on the Day of Judgment happens by both body and soul.

After that, Allâh concealed the cave and its trace from the sight of the people. Some of the believers said, “Build a structure that would stand as a landmark and memorial of their location.” Others said, “Build a mosque for one to seek blessings at their place.”

The story of the people of the cave went a s described Allâh made it for people a reminder, a lesson, and a proof of His Great Power.

Allâh has Power over everything.

Our hope is that the readers enjoy these stories derived from the Noble Qur’an and learn lessons from them. We ask Allāh to grant our readers the ability to perform the acceptable, good deeds.
