 <h2>Spain floods intensifies as 205 people die</h2>
 <p>
Flash flooding across Spain killed at least 205 people this week after torrential rain left towns and villages submerged and turned streets into rivers in the eastern and southern parts of the country. In some areas, several monthsâ€™ worth of rain fell in a single day.

Since Monday, when the deluge began, residents in affected areas have struggled to clear mud- and tree-covered streets. Cars and trucks were swept away and dumped in piles, blocking roads. Rescuers have carried out evacuations by helicopter and boat, and swaths of the country have been left without electricity.</p>
